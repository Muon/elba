Elba
====

Elba is a simple-to-use library designed to enable the easy bridging of the
chasm between the worlds of C++ and Lua. Elba is only partially complete at the
moment, not properly tested and lacks documentation, so it is in no way
recommended for production *anything* right now.

Features
--------

* `operator[]`-style table manipulation
* primitive type and std::string assignment/retrieval
* binding functions
* retrieval of functions from the Lua state
* class binding

Todo
----

* class properties
* table iterators
* write more unit tests
* review code
* write documentation
